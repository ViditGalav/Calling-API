# Calling-API
This project demonstrates how to fetch stargazers (users who have starred a repository) of a GitHub repository using the GitHub API and the reqwest crate in Rust. The main code file showcases an asynchronous HTTP GET request to the GitHub API's stargazers endpoint for a specific repository.
